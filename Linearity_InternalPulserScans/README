Description:
====================
Basic analysis of front-end pulser scans to assess linearity. The pulser scans are primarily intended as a rough check on the standard non-linearity correction.

Data sequentially increments the amplitude of internal pulsers, whose pulses are digitized. Assuming the linearity of the pulsers, over a given region, the scan data are used to assess the linearity of ADCs. The pulsers can be attenuated in order to test lower energies with full range of amplitude settings.

Instructions:
====================
1.) Make an up-to-date DSChannelMaps.root file by executing the CreateDSChannelMapsFile.C ROOT macro.
2.) Explore the data and determine the run ranges for each attenuation, as well as any data cleaning that may need to be done.
3.) Run ProduceChannelList.cc and make sure that the list of channels in the data matches the list in PlotSavedSingleChanAndAtten.cc, GetWiggle.cc, and elsewhere. Can also run ProducePreampDigitizerList.cc to have that mapping as a reference.
4.) Make sure the path to the desired files is correct in the TFile and Residual File used by PulserLinSingleChanAndAtten.cc. Also check the gatified file path in PulserLinSingleChanAndAtten.cc and PlotSavedSingleChanAndAtten.cc.
5.) Create results/ directory.
6.) Execute PulserLinSingleChanAndAtten.cc on the desired module, run range, energy estimator, pulser attenuation setting. Syntax is:
	./PulserLinSingleChanAndAtten <module> <startRun> <endRun> <channel> <energyEstimator> <attenuationSetting> <doSave>	
7.) Execute PlotSavedSingleChanAndAtten.cc on each module, energy estimator, and attenuation. Syntax is:
	./PlotSavedSingleChanAndAtten <module> <energyEstimator> <attenuationSetting> <gain>
8.) Execute GetWiggle.cc to get the RMS wiggle of each channel. Syntax is:
	./GetWiggle <module> <energyEstimator> <attenuationSetting> <gain>
