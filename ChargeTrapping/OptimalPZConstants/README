Description:
====================
Examining optimal effective pole-zero time constants and inferring mean free drift times of charge carriers.

Scripts were developed in the MJSW 201610 environment.
====================
Instructions:
====================
1.) Run FindOptimal.cc (./FindOptimal <arg>) on each DS and each STC. This reads in Pinghan's .txt data files, finds the optimal tau & fwhm, and outputs a text file (OptimalFWHMvsTau_*.txt) of the following form.
[chan] [optTau] [eoptTau] [optFWHM] [eoptFWHM] [qtTau]
The script also outputs a root file (FWHMvsTau_*.root) containing FWHM-vs-tau plots for each detector. FindOptimal_ADC.cc omits conversions to keV.  
2.) run GraphSTC.cc to make a graph of the tauQT values for each STC detector. Save this graph to an "UPDATE" root file STCvDS_tauQT_graphs.root.
3.0) put the detSN list "detSNVec.push_back("<<detSN<<");" into the remaining scripts. This allows the remaining scripts to know which DS detectors to draw.
3.) run GraphDS.cc (./GraphDS <arg>) on each DS to make a graph of the tauQT values for each DS detector that is also in the STC data. Save these graphs to the same "UPDATE" root file as above (STCvDS_tauQT_graphs.root).
4.) run GraphSTCvDS.cc to combine the graphs into a multi graph
