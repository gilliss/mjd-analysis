Description:
====================
Scripts to calculate the event rate between 1000-1400 keV for different groupings of hardware. A check on 2nbb rate.
First script calculates the rate for each detector, and the subsequent scripts combine the individual detector rates accoring to hardware grouping.
====================
Instructions:
====================
1.) Make an up-to-date DSChannelMaps.root file by executing the CreateDSChannelMapsFile.C ROOT macro.
2.) Execute 2nuBB_Systematics.cc, using the following syntax.
	./2nuBB_Systematics <DS> <Module> <CutScheme>		
This script outputs a root file with energy histograms for each det, as well as a text file with the integral within the specified ROI, and other useful info.
Run this on each DS, Module, and CutScheme.
3.) Run the secondary scripts to get the 2nubb rate by hardware grouping. Syntax is "./2nubb_RateBy*.cc <DS> <Module> <enrType> <save>." Run this on each DS, Module, and enrType. 
	2nuBB_RateByDet.cc
		This script makes a scatter plot of all detector rates in the specified ROI, for detectors of a given enrichment type. It overlays these results by cut. 
	2nuBB_RateByString.cc
	2nuBB_RateByCC.cc
		Script is hardcoded with the kPreampDigitizer numbers for the relevant modules and DSs.
	2nuBB_RateByMB.cc
		Script is hardcoded with the CC and MB mapping for the relevant modules and DSs
