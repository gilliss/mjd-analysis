Description:
====================
Scripts to calculate time since last event (TSLE, also referred to as dT). These scripts were used to calculate livetime via TSLE for potential use in the 0nbb result exposure.
The *_splitjobs.cc script does the same thing as dT.cc, but splits the jobs into data subsets (was used to split up DS5, which was large).
====================
Instructions:
====================
Execute dT.cc with ./dT <DS> <dataType (Bg=0,Cal=1)>
Execute dT_splitjobs.cc with ./dT_splitjobs <DS> <dataType> <subsetLo> <subsetHi>
These scripts will output ROOT files with branches for channel, run, TSLE (dT), and globalTime.
